# Selus Front Page

The Selus homepage was built as a test for Mondo Labs, taking a PSD file and rendering it into a funcitonal, single-page web app.

This is a Ruby on Rails v5 application.

I utilized Bootstrap to ensure mobile-first layout, and used the Bootstrap grid system to build the layout.

Specific difficulties included using images outside of the grid system, and uploading a Rails 5 application with image assets to Heroku, as most existing documentation is meant for previous versions of Rails.
